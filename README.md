# Wine_Clustering

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the application of the K-means clustering technique to the Wine dataset. The analysis aims to gain insights into the characteristics of different wines and uncover patterns within the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The Wine dataset used in this analysis includes information on various chemical properties of different wines. The dataset is commonly used for classification and clustering tasks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis explores key features of the dataset, providing visualizations and summary statistics to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. The analysis includes but is not limited to:

- Distribution of chemical properties.
- Correlation analysis.
- Univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualizations.

## K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is applied to group similar wines based on their chemical properties. The number of clusters is determined through Elbow and Silhouette analysis. The resulting clusters provide insights into the natural groupings within the dataset.
